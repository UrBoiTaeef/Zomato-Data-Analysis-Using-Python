# Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to uncover customer preferences and ordering behavior. By leveraging Python and its powerful libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, key questions are answered:

## Key Questions Addressed:
- Do more restaurants provide online delivery compared to offline services?
- What types of restaurants are most favored by customers?
- What price range do couples prefer for dining?

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling null values, converting data types, and normalizing ratings.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Created histograms, count plots, and heatmaps to explore trends in ratings, order preferences, and restaurant types.
- **Statistical Insights**: 
  - Dining restaurants are preferred for offline orders, while cafes are popular for online delivery.
  - Couples prefer dining options costing around 300 INR.
  - Online orders generally receive higher ratings compared to offline services.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Python can be effectively utilized to analyze real-world datasets, providing actionable insights for businesses to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
