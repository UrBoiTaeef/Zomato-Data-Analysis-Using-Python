# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to derive actionable insights into customer preferences and behavior. By leveraging Python and its powerful libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, the analysis answers key questions, including:

Do more restaurants provide online delivery compared to offline services?
What types of restaurants are most favored by customers?
What price range do couples prefer for dining?
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling null values, converting data types, and normalizing ratings.
Visualizations: Created histograms, count plots, and heatmaps to explore trends in ratings, order preferences, and restaurant types.
Statistical Insights:
Identified that dining restaurants are preferred for offline orders, while cafes are popular for online delivery.
Discovered that the most common cost range for couples is 300 INR.
Observed that online orders generally receive higher ratings compared to offline services.
Tools and Libraries:
Python: Core programming language used for data analysis.
Libraries:
Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Python can be effectively utilized to perform meaningful analysis on real-world datasets, providing insights for businesses to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
